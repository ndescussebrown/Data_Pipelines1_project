# Data_Pipelines1_project
This repo documents the work performed for the Data Pipelines 1 assignment for my MSc in Data Engineering with the Data ScienceTech Institute

The brief for the assignment was as follows:

Modeling of an XML database to store the data of a tour operator. 

You should distinguish among different kinds of tourism: cultural tourism, adventure, ecotourims, etc. You should model the various aspects of a tour operator: destinations, activities, tours, clients, guides, etc.

* Describe your modeling choices in natural language. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of your choices and discuss them.
* Write an XML Schema that represents your modeling
* Write a valid XML database against this model, containing a representative extract of the data of some tour operator.
* Imagine 3 different scenarios requiring the visualization of part of this data and write 3 XSL stylesheets to answer them.
* Imagine a 4th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in another XML format and write a stylesheet for this.
* Bonus: Imagine a 5th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in JSON format and write a stylesheet for this.
